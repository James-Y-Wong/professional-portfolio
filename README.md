# Professional Portfolio

## Description

For this project, I re-created a professional portfolio page. I used the knowledge I have gained in the past 8 weeks and applied it to this portfolio.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to build a professional portfolio to showcase my skills. This will be sent to employers looking to fill positions. The portfolio must be able to allow potential employers to easily read a little bit about me, see my deployed projects, and contact me if necessary.

## Result

The below picture is the final result. This will continue to be a work in progress as I develop and learn new skills and deploy more complex projects.

Header shows logo with nav bar links to sections of the page as well as downloadable resume.
