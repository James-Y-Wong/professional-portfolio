                    <p>Hi there! I am a Full Stack Web Developer with a background in Supply Chain. I am currently enrolled in Full Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp at Georgia Tech progressing towards a certificate in Full Stack Web Development. Newly acquired front-end skills include: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, frameworks and libraries, and responsive web design. As I continue my journey in coding bootcamp, I will gain knowledge in back-end and full stack skills.</p>
                    <p>When I am not developing applications, I enjoy hiking, watching Atlanta sports, playing tennis, running, eating, and anything Netflix. I am 36 years old from Atlanta, Georgia. I am married with no kids (yet), just 4 fur babies.</p>
                    <p>I am excited to apply what I have learned to build projects that have impact to users across the world. With the knowledge and skills I have gained from coding bootcamp, I hope to have an opportunity to be a valuable member of your team! Reach out to me to chat! [here].</p>
